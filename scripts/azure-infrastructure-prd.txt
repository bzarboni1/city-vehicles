# Azure Infrastructure Setup PRD

## Project Overview
Set up the complete Azure infrastructure for the Ottawa City Vehicles Detection POC, ensuring all services stay within free-tier limits while following Azure Well-Architected Framework principles.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Deploy Azure Functions for camera polling and image processing
- Configure Azure Blob Storage for image storage with secure access
- Set up Azure Computer Vision API for vehicle detection and OCR
- Implement Azure Key Vault for secure secrets management
- Configure Azure Application Insights for monitoring and logging
- Establish proper networking and security configurations

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Stay within Azure free-tier limits for all services
- Implement security best practices with managed identities
- Ensure 99.9% availability for the Functions runtime
- Minimize cold start times for Azure Functions
- Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- Follow Azure naming conventions and resource organization

### Technical Requirements
- Use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Bicep for Infrastructure as Code
- Configure RBAC with least privilege access
- Implement proper tagging strategy for resource management
- Set up diagnostic settings for all resources
- Configure backup and disaster recovery where applicable

## Success Criteria
- All Azure resources deployed successfully in a single resource group
- Functions can authenticate to other Azure services using managed identity
- Blob Storage accessible with proper access controls
- Computer Vision API responding within free-tier limits
- All secrets stored securely in Key Vault
- Monitoring and alerting configured for all critical components
- Infrastructure deployable through automated scripts

## Acceptance Criteria
- Resource group created with proper naming convention
- Azure Functions app deployed with Python 3.11 runtime
- Storage account created with blob containers and proper access policies
- Computer Vision resource provisioned in appropriate region
- Key Vault configured with access policies for Functions
- Application Insights workspace linked to Functions
- Network security groups configured if needed
- All resources tagged consistently for cost tracking

## Out of Scope
- Multi-region deployment (single region for POC)
- Advanced networking features like VNets (using default networking)
- Premium tiers or paid features
- Custom domains or SSL certificates
- Integration with on-premises systems
