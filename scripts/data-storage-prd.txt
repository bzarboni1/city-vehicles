# Data Storage and Management PRD

## Project Overview
Design and implement a comprehensive data storage strategy for the Ottawa City Vehicles Detection system, ensuring efficient storage, retrieval, and management of images, analysis results, and system metadata while optimizing for Azure free-tier usage.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Store traffic camera images with organized folder structure
- Maintain analysis results in queryable format
- Implement data lifecycle management and archival policies
- Provide secure access to stored data with proper permissions
- Enable efficient data retrieval for reporting and analysis
- Store system logs and performance metrics
- Implement backup and recovery procedures
- Support data export capabilities for compliance

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Stay within Azure free-tier storage limits (5 GB total)
- Optimize storage costs through intelligent tiering
- Ensure data durability and availability (99.9%)
- Implement fast data access patterns for frequently accessed data
- Minimize storage operations to stay within free-tier transaction limits
- Ensure GDPR compliance for any personal data

### Technical Requirements
- Use Azure Blob Storage for image storage with hot/cool tier optimization
- Implement Azure Table Storage or Cosmos DB free tier for structured data
- Configure proper security and access controls
- Set up automated data lifecycle policies
- Implement data compression where appropriate
- Use managed identities for secure service-to-service access

### Table Storage Schema
- **ImageMetadata**: Store image properties and processing status
- **AnalysisResults**: Store vehicle detection and classification results
- **SystemLogs**: Store application logs and error information
- **PerformanceMetrics**: Store processing times and resource usage

## Data Lifecycle Management
- **Active Data (0-7 days)**: Hot tier blob storage, immediate access
- **Recent Data (7-30 days)**: Cool tier blob storage, occasional access
- **Archive Data (30+ days)**: Archive tier or deletion based on retention policy
- **Analysis Results**: Retain indefinitely in Table Storage (within limits)
- **System Logs**: Retain for 90 days for debugging and compliance

## Success Criteria
- All data stored within free-tier limits
- Sub-second access times for recent data
- Zero data loss during normal operations
- Automated lifecycle management working correctly
- Secure access controls properly configured
- Backup and recovery procedures tested and documented

## Acceptance Criteria
- Blob Storage configured with appropriate access tiers
- Table Storage schema implemented with proper indexing
- Data lifecycle policies automated and tested
- Security policies restrict access to authorized services only
- Storage usage monitoring and alerting configured
- Data export functionality available for compliance
- Retention policies enforced automatically
- Performance metrics meet defined SLAs

## Security Requirements
- All data encrypted at rest using Azure Storage encryption
- Access controlled through managed identities and RBAC
- No public access to sensitive data containers
- Audit logging enabled for all data access operations
- Secure data deletion when retention period expires
- Network security rules configured if needed

## Backup and Recovery
- Leverage Azure Storage built-in redundancy (LRS for free tier)
- Implement application-level backup for critical analysis results
- Document recovery procedures for various failure scenarios
- Test recovery procedures monthly
- Maintain recovery time objective (RTO) of 1 hour
- Maintain recovery point objective (RPO) of 15 minutes

## Monitoring and Alerting
- Monitor storage usage against free-tier limits
- Alert when approaching storage capacity limits
- Track storage operation counts to avoid overage charges
- Monitor data access patterns for optimization opportunities
- Generate monthly storage utilization reports
